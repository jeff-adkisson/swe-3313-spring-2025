# Final Presentation Instructions and Rubric

Once your implementation is ready, you will produce a polished 5 minute presentation of your working application. Your audience is your client (me). Assume that your client (me) brought 40 members of his team (all of you) with him to view the final presentation.

This is where you get to shine. Many final presentations just stagger me. By now you will know how to make a great presentation for the target audience.

## Requirements

Your 5 minute final presentation will include:

1) A run through of your working (compiled/running) application that demonstrates every screen and logging on as both a user and an administrator.
2) A comparison of your final application's user interface and your Marvel UI design. Explain why or why not your implementation met your design and what you learned from that. In real life, when your mockup does not match your final implementation, your client may be upset... it's like an architect designing a soaring skyscraper and the builder delivers a large tent. If your final work does not match your design, own it and learn from it. 

Your presentation can be checked into GitHub as an MP4 or posted to a public link at YouTube or Vimeo.

You will also:

1) Create a link to your final presentation in your team's GitHub repo project documentation. Make sure the link is easily found and organized into your prior work.
2) Answer questions about your implementation after we present your video to the entire group. Every team member must participate.
3) Be present for both days of presentations. Attendance will be taken on presentation days.

### Submission Steps

The entire team will work execute the final presentation EFFORT. *All of you need* to review the completed video. This is a team effort and the team will succeed or fail as a group.

You have worked hard to get here. Show off your work and be proud of what you accomplished. Put some real effort and polish into your presentation to get your client excited about what you produced.

Once your work is complete, ***every* team member will do the following:** post a link to your team's Github repo in the Final Presentation assignment in D2L before 4:59PM on the deadline. Note that this deadline is one minute before the first presentation day - not at midnight like you might be accustomed.

If you forget to post your link in D2L, you will receive a late submission penalty (see syllabus). Do not rely on your teammates for this. Everyone must submit the link themselves (it's connected to the gradebook).

### Grading Rubric

#### Component Percentages

1.  Final Presentation - 90%
2.  Attendance Both Presentation Days - 10%, *be present both days or 0%*

#### Final Presentation (90% of total)

-  90 to 100%: meets all requirements, well-recorded, well organized, and highly professional. Polished work gets the top grade.
-  80% to 89%: meets all requirements, may have some recording or organizational issues.
-  70% to 79%: meets most requirements, may have some recording or organizational issues.
-  69% or below: does not meet most requirements or is very poorly recorded.

*Note: Presentations posted to Github will not be graded.* 

#### Attendance Both Days (10% of total)

-  100% - Attended both days
-  0% - Attended one or zero days.

*Attendance can be excused with documentation. See syllabus.*

### Academic Honesty

Your work must be your own. Do not plagiarize under any circumstances. All work is subject to review by TurnItIn, etc.

More importantly, this course is a waste of your time if you do not do the work yourself. If you are tempted to cheat, you need to ask yourself why you are here and what you hope to accomplish in your career if you get the grade, but have minimal ability to perform the work after you leave the University.

### Team Grading

Everyone on the team will receive the same grade with one exception. It follows.

Anyone not participating in the project may be removed from the team and have to perform the project alone. Before anyone can be "fired" from a team, I must meet with the *entire team* and hear what is happening. Do not fire anyone from your team without my explicit prior agreement.
