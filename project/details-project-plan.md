# Project Plan Submission and Rubric

## Deliverables

All deliverables will be in your team Github repo or YouTrack.

All deliverable documentation will be written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). Your Gantt chart will be produced in [YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/). Your presentation will be produced in whatever video recording software you prefer.

Your deliverables for this component include:

1.  Introduction (Github/Markdown)
2.  Team resumes (Github/Markdown)
3.  Team assignments (Github/Markdown)
4.  Technology selection (Github/Markdown)
5.  Project plan milestones, epics and stories and Gantt chart (YouTrack)
6.  3-5 minute recorded video presentation describing your plan, technology selection and team assignments (post to Github)

## Requirements

1.  [Very carefully read the Project Plan section in the main README file.](README.md#project-plan) 
    I recommend printing it and carefully highlighting/commenting everything in that section. It is very detailed and I have high expectations for each team.
2.  Check all documentation into your team Github repo. Make sure all documentation is linked, organized, spell checked, and grammatically correct.
3.  Create your presentation video using Loom. Share the link to your Loom video in your GitHub repo. Make sure the link is public.
4.  Prove you can follow my instructions. Engineering is a very precise art. Some things we design, other things we follow. Here you are designing your project plan and carefully following my requirements to execute and submit the work.

### Submission Steps

The entire team will work execute the project plan requirements. *All of you need* to review the completed work. This is a team effort and the team will succeed or fail as a group.

### Academic Honesty

Your work must be your own. Do not plagiarize under any circumstances. All work is subject to review by TurnItIn, etc.

More importantly, this course is a waste of your time if you do not do the work yourself. If you are tempted to cheat, you need to ask yourself why you are here and what you hope to accomplish in your career if you get the grade, but have minimal ability to perform the work after you leave the University.

### Team Grading

Everyone on the team will receive the same grade one exception. It follows.

Anyone not participating in the project may be removed from the team and have to perform the project alone. Before anyone can be "fired" from a team, I must meet with the *entire team* and hear what is happening. Do not fire anyone from your team without my explicit prior agreement.
