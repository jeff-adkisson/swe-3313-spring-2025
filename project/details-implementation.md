# Implementation Instructions and Rubric

Finally, you are ready to produce your application! You have planned most of the semester and you know exactly what to make.

Now you will execute the requirements by implementing your User Interface Design and Technical Design. Your goal is to make your implementation look as close to the User Interface Design as possible.

## Requirements

For the Implementation phase, you will produce and submit via GitHub:

- Operational, well-written code that follows your language's style guide. For example, do not use Java conventions in a Python app. Your implementation must perform all of the Must Have requirements including data storage to CSV, JSON, or SQL. You must be able to start and restart the application and all data that was created/entered remains available on restart.
- A well-written, well-organized  **README.md** *in the root of your source coode* linked from your main GitHub repo's project documentation that includes:
   - a brief description of your application (from an end-user point of view),
   - environment requirements, such as "MacOS or Linux or Windows" (be very specific the systems and operating systems where you application can run),
   - steps to clone and build the application on a fresh machine. Be very specific - I will be attempting to follow these steps on my machine and they better have all of the steps, dependencies, gotchas, database schema scripts, warnings, etc. I need to get your application working without a lot of fuss.
   - any other important information you need to pass along to someone trying to setup and run your application.
- Optionally, you can provide a video presentation showing the working application and any important notes how to setup and execute the application. If you are confident I can get your application working, you do not need to produce this.

#### Code That Does Not Compile Gets a 50% Grade or Lower, Automatically

**It is essential that your code compiles**, even if it does not achieve every requirement. Do not submit code that will not compile. Fix it before submitting. If I cannot compile it, I cannot grade it. Have everyone on the team verify it compiles and check the README.md in the root of the source code to verify it explains how to get a successful compilation.

***Producing working code is our primary goal. Everything else we do in this field supports that goal.***

### Submission Steps

The entire team will work execute the implementation EFFORT. *All of you need* to review the completed work. This is a team effort and the team will succeed or fail as a group.

Our number one goal as Software Engineers is to deliver working software. All of the documentation, planning, and design were steps to reach a working implementation. This is the part that matters most. It also has the biggest contribution to your grade.

Once your work is complete, ***every* team member will do the following:** post a link to your team's Github repo in the Implementation assignment in D2L before 4:59PM on the deadline. Note that this deadline is one minute before the first presentation day - not at midnight like you might be accustomed.

If you forget to post your link in D2L, you will receive a late submission penalty (see syllabus). Do not rely on your teammates for this. Everyone must submit the link themselves (it's connected to the gradebook).

### Grading Rubric

#### Component Percentages

1.  Working, complete, well-written source code that follows your Coding Style Guide - 80%
2.  README.md in the root of your source code
3.  Optional 3-5 minute video presentation showing running application, how to build/configure, etc. - 0% (optional)

#### Project Source Code (80% of total)

-  90 to 100%: meets all requirements, well-coded, well organized, and highly professional. Polished work gets the top grade.
-  80% to 89%: meets all requirements, may have some coding or organizational issues.
-  70% to 79%: meets most requirements, may have some coding or organizational issues.
-  69% or below: does not meet most requirements or is very poorly coded.
-  50% or below: does not compile (even if it meets all or most other requirements).

*Note: Source code not posted to Github will not be graded. Also note that you are submitting source code - not a JAR file or EXE or other compiled artifact.*

#### README.md in root of source code (20% of total)

-  90 to 100%: meets all requirements, well-written well organized, and highly professional. Polished work gets the top grade.
-  80% to 89%: meets all requirements, may have some minor graphical issues or organizational issues.
-  70% to 79%: meets most requirements, may have some minor graphical or organizational issues.
-  69% or below: does not meet most requirements or is very poorly drawn or contains incorrect information.

*Note: Documentation not posted to Github and linked to your Markdown will not be graded.*

### Academic Honesty

Your work must be your own. Do not plagiarize under any circumstances. All work is subject to review by TurnItIn, etc.

More importantly, this course is a waste of your time if you do not do the work yourself. If you are tempted to cheat, you need to ask yourself why you are here and what you hope to accomplish in your career if you get the grade, but have minimal ability to perform the work after you leave the University.

### Team Grading

Everyone on the team will receive the same grade with one exception. It follows.

Anyone not participating in the project may be removed from the team and have to perform the project alone. Before anyone can be "fired" from a team, I must meet with the *entire team* and hear what is happening. Do not fire anyone from your team without my explicit prior agreement.
