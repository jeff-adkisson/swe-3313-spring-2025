# Peer Evaluation Instructions and Rubric

Hopefully you have an outstanding team experience during this project. If not, hopefully you learned something about how challenging working in a team can be and how important it is to have the right people on the team with you.

## Submission Steps

1.  Rate each teammate (including yourself) between 0 and 30 points. Your ratings will *not* be shared with your teammates. You can share them if you wish, but I will not share them.
    *You are welcome to give everyone a top score including yourself. Or you can award less.*

2.  Submit the ratings for each teammate via D2L in the Peer Evaluation folder before the deadline. Do not miss the deadline - these are easy points. Your submission will look like this:

    -  Teammate 1 name - *points* (0 to 30)
    -  Teammate 2 name - *points* (0 to 30)
    -  Teammate *n* name - *points* (0 to 30)

    You do not have to provide a reason for your points assignment. If you do provide a reason (and many do, sometimes to my amusement or horror), I will not share it with the team.

Your score will be an average of your self-score and your teammates' evaluation of your contribution. For example, if you give yourself a 30 and your three teammates give you 30, 30 and 20, you will receive ((30+30+30+20)/4)/30=91.67%.

Your individual score will be recorded in the grade book and *not* shared with your teammates.

If you receive less than the score you expected from your teammates, do a bit of introspection and ask yourself if perhaps there was a bit more you could have done. Be honest with yourself. Please do not attack your teammates if you do not get the score you hoped to receive.

#### Suggestion For Evaluations In Your Future Career

If you ever find yourself in management or a lead role where you evaluate other peoples' work, try to follow this simple rule:

-  Never give a formal evaluation that is a surprise. To achieve that, always address performance issues *immediately* rather than weeks or months later. If you do this, when a formal evaluation occurs, you have already set the standard of communication that everyone is open, honest, direct, professional, and that professional criticism is delivered in a timely fashion so immediately action can be taken to correct the issue going forward.

If you find yourself in an evaluation where the manager/lead did not surface issues in a timely fashion, ask that you get feedback far sooner. 

Try to make every evaluation a learning experience to improve your skills.
