# Requirements Instructions and Rubric

To start writing the requirements, [you must read the notes from your customer](README.md#customer-notes-for-requirements-elicitation). From there you can start to put your requirements and priorities into a rough form. Then you will perform requirements elicitation in person with your customer to ensure you have a clear idea what is expected and what priority to assign each requirement.

After you have a rough list, you will divide the requirements into versions, milestones, epics and related stories.

Here are your deliverables in this phase:

1.  [Requirements Introduction](README.md#requirements-introduction) in your repo's main README.md file and links to requirements, use case diagram, decision diagram, and presentation. This is integrated into the documentation you produced for the Project Plan so everything can be found (but is not contained) from a single point.
2.  [Requirements](README.md#requirements-writing) organized into versions, milestones, epics and stories.
    Note that the version you implementing by the end of the semester is Version 1. Version 2, etc. will contain the requirements you decide are *not* "must-have" requirements. So hint, hint, it sounds like Version 1 is limited to Must Have requirements.
3.  One [Use Case Diagram](README.md#use-case-diagram) showing the major functionality of the application and all relevant actors for all versions (not just Version 1).
4.  One [Decision Table](README.md#decision-table) showing the rules and actions a user can take if logging in as a user or administrator for all versions (not just Version 1).
5.  A 3-5 minute [Presentation](README.md#requirements-presentation) giving a high level review of the requirements to your customer. Do not just read the requirements!

All deliverables must be written in Markdown and posted to your team GitHub repo. Graphics such as diagrams will be displayed in your markdown and included in your repo.

Note that you do not need to update YouTrack. That is a good system for managing this material, but it is beyond the scope of the course. We only use YouTrack for the Gantt chart. When you one day find yourself working on a project with many requirements like this one, I hope you will consider using a system like YouTrack or Jira or Trello to help manage these artifacts.

## Requirements

1.  [Very carefully read the Requirements section in the main README file.](README.md#requirements) 
    I recommend printing it and carefully highlighting/commenting everything in that section. It is very detailed and I have high expectations for each team.
2.  Check all documentation into your team Github repo. Make sure all documentation is linked, organized, spell checked, and grammatically correct.
3.  Check your video presentation into your team Github repo. Create a folder called "presentations". Name the presentation "1-requirements-presentation.[extension]" [Free Github accounts do not allow massive files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github), so be sure to compress your presentation a bit (not zipped [which won't help anyway] - [just shrink it to a smaller size where it's still high-resolution](https://multimedia.easeus.com/video-converter-tips/compress-video-vlc.html). Large files like video can be made to fit on Github easily, so be ready for this bit of effort if the original file is too big to check in without a bit of compression.

### Submission Steps

The entire team will work execute the requirements EFFORT. *All of you need* to review the completed work. This is a team effort and the team will succeed or fail as a group.

Requirements are critical to the success of your project. Be very careful here and strive for accuracy and outstanding communication technique.

Once your work is complete, ***every* team member will do the following:** post a link to your team's Github repo in the Requirements assignment in D2L before 11:59PM on Thursday, October 26, 2023.

If you forget to post your link in D2L, you will receive a late submission penalty (see syllabus). Do not rely on your teammates for this. Everyone must submit the link themselves (it's connected to the gradebook).

### Grading Rubric

#### Component Percentages

1.  Introduction to Requirements and links to requirements and diagrams and presentation - 5%
3.  Requirements organized into versions (there is more than one!), milestones, epics and stories - 50%
4.  One use case diagram - 12.5%
5.  One decision table - 12.5%
6.  3-5 minute video presentation describing your plan, technology selection and team assignments (Github) - 20%

#### Written Scoring (55% total including Introduction)

-  90 to 100%: meets all requirements, well-written well organized, and highly professional. Polished work gets the top grade.
-  80% to 89%: meets all requirements, may have some writing or organizational issues.
-  70% to 79%: meets most requirements, may have some writing or organizational issues.
-  69% or below: does not meet most requirements or is very poorly written.

*Note: Written work not posted to Github using Markdown will not be graded.*

#### Use Case Diagram Scoring (12.5% of total)

-  90 to 100%: meets all requirements, well-written well organized, and highly professional. Polished work gets the top grade.
-  80% to 89%: meets all requirements, may have some minor graphical issues or organizational issues.
-  70% to 79%: meets most requirements, may have some minor graphical or organizational issues.
-  69% or below: does not meet most requirements or is very poorly drawn or contains incorrect information.

*Note: Diagrams not posted to Github and linked to your Markdown will not be graded.*

#### Decision Table Scoring (12.5% of total)

-  90 to 100%: meets all requirements, well-written well organized, and highly professional. Polished work gets the top grade.
-  80% to 89%: meets all requirements, may have some minor graphical issues or organizational issues.
-  70% to 79%: meets most requirements, may have some minor graphical or organizational issues.
-  69% or below: does not meet most requirements or is very poorly drawn or contains incorrect information.

*Note: Tables not posted to Github and linked to your Markdown will not be graded.*

#### Presentation Scoring (20% total)

*Do not just read requirements!*

-  90% to 100%: meets all requirements, well-organized, easy to follow audio. Polished work gets the top grade.
-  80% to 89%: meets all requirements, easy to follow audio, may have some organization issues.
-  70% to 79%: meets most requirements, may have some organization or audio issues.
-  69% or below: does not meet most requirements or has little or no audio.

*Note: Presentations not posted to Github will not be graded.*

### Academic Honesty

Your work must be your own. Do not plagiarize under any circumstances. All work is subject to review by TurnItIn, etc.

More importantly, this course is a waste of your time if you do not do the work yourself. If you are tempted to cheat, you need to ask yourself why you are here and what you hope to accomplish in your career if you get the grade, but have minimal ability to perform the work after you leave the University.

### Team Grading

Everyone on the team will receive the same grade one exception. It follows.

Anyone not participating in the project may be removed from the team and have to perform the project alone. Before anyone can be "fired" from a team, I must meet with the *entire team* and hear what is happening. Do not fire anyone from your team without my explicit prior agreement.
